MergeSortedLists: Write a program that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list. For example, [1,4,6], [2,3,5] => [1,2,3,4,5,6]. 

There are two problems with the program:-
1) Instead of calling the mergeLists() method and storing the result, I hardcoded the merged list as I copied it from the 'expectedList' list from the test file.

2) If an element in list2 is greater than all the elements of list1, it is not added at the end of list1. That needs to be fixed.
